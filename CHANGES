## 1.20.0

        * Fix #121: the -i flag produces an .info file even if
          the %expect pragma is violated
        * Fix #131: qualify uses of Prelude functions in generated code
        * Fix #161: drop fewer parse items when generating an .info file
        * Introduce the %shift directive to resolve shift/reduce
          conflicts explicitly, useful in conjunction with %expect 0
        * Remove the deprecated build configuration flag 'small_base'

## 1.19.12

        * Fix for building with GHC 8.8.x
        * Move custom Setup preprocessing steps into a separate
          executable, like Alex

        * Bump upper bounds
        * Fix build with GHC 8.4.1-alpha

## 1.19.8

        * Fix issue #94 (some grammars don't compile due to new type
          signatures introduced to allow overloading to be used)

## 1.19.7

        * Fix missing test suite files in the sdist

## 1.19.6

        * Manually generate Parser.hs using Makefile before sdist,
          to fix bootstrapping problems with cabal sandboxes & new-build
        * Documentation fixes
        * Fixed GLR support
        * new option -p/--pretty prints the grammar rules (only) to a file
        * Added generation of additional type signatures to enable use
          of typeclasses in monadic parsers.

## 1.19.5

        * fixes for GHC 7.10
        * Code cleanups (thanks Index Int <vlad.z.4096@gmail.com>)

## 1.19.4

        * fix for GHC 7.10 (Applicative/Monad, #19, #21)

## 1.19.3

        * fix for GHC 7.2 (#16)

## 1.19.2

        * fixes for clang (XCode 5)

## 1.19.1

        * repackaged to build with GHC 7.7+

## 1.19

        * necessary changes to work with GHC 7.8

## 1.18.10

        * Fix build with GHC 7.6

## 1.18.8

        * Fix a packaging bug (cabal-install-0.10.2 didn't put the
          Happy-generated files in the sdist)

## 1.18.7

        * Fix a bug in error handling when using %monad without %lexer

## 1.18

        * New feature: EBNF-style paramterized macros, thanks to
          Iavor Diatchki.
        * Works with Cabal 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6
        * A few minor bugfixes

## 1.17

        * Cabal 1.2 is required
        * Works with upcoming GHC 6.8.1
        * Fix the 'parE' bug (poor error message for errors in the grammar)
        * Some performance improvements to Happy itself

## 1.16

	* Switch to a Cabal build system: you need a recent version of Cabal
	  (1.1.6 or later).  If you have GHC 6.4.2, then you need to upgrade
	  Cabal before building Happy.  GHC 6.6 is fine.

	* New %error directive

	* New production forms: {%% .. } and {%^ .. }

	* Added Attribute Grammar support, by Robert Dockins

## 1.15

	* New %expect directive
	* the list of tokens passed to happyError now includes the current
          token (not %lexer).
	* added support for ambiguous grammars via Generalized LR parsing
	* added %partial to indicate a parser that can return a result
	  before EOF is reached.

## 1.14

	* New meta-variable $> represents the rightmost token.

	* Happy's OPTIONS pragma is merged with an existing one in
	  the grammar file, if any.

## 1.13

	* Support for newer versions of GHC (>= 5.04).

	* Addition of an experimental flag: --strict.

## 1.11

	* tokens no longer have a default precedence - if you 
	  want a token to have a precedence, you have to declare it.

	* bugfix to templates for GHC on 64-bit platforms.

## 1.10

	* bugfixes, and minor performance improvements,

	* most of the examples work again.

## 1.9

	* A grammar may now contain several entry points, allowing
	  several parsers to share parts of the grammar.

	* Some bugfixes.

## 1.8

      * Parser table compression, and more efficient
        table encoding when used with GHC.  Large grammars
        can now be compiled in much less time/space than
        before using GHC.

      * Yacc-style operator precedence, thanks to patches
        from Hermann Oliveira Rodrigues <hermann@dcc.ufmg.br>
        and Josef Svenningsson <josefs@cs.chalmers.se>.

      * A debug option which causes the generated parser to
        print tracing information at each step during parsing.

## 1.6

* Now written in, and generates, Haskell 98.

* Several bug fixes.

* A new option, -c, generates parsers that use GHC's unsafeCoerce# 
  primitive to speed up parsing and cut down the binary size.
  The -c option can only be used with the -g (GHC extensions) option.

* Parsers generated with the -g option will compile to smaller binaries
  now - some sources of parser-bloat were identified and squished.

* Happy has a new Open Source license, based on the BSD license.

* A sample Haskell parser using Happy is included.

## 1.5

* Many bug fixes to the error recovery support, found by experimenting
  with the Haskell grammar and layout.

* Happy is about 5 times faster on large examples, due to some
  changes in the LALR(1) algorithms.

## 1.2

* Supports Haskell 1.4

* Lots of bugs fixed

* Performance: the parser generator is at least 20% faster, and
  generated parsers should be faster due to the replacement of a
  data type with a newtype.

* Simple error recovery: designed to be enough to implement the
  Haskell layout rule.

* Revamped monad support: the monad can now be threaded through
  the lexer, enabling passing of state between the parser and the
  lexer (handy for the Haskell layout rule), and consistent error
  handling.

* The %newline feature is removed, the same effect can be achieved
  using the new monad support.

## 0.9:

* Happy should be much faster than before.

* Generated parsers will be 5-10% smaller.

* Happy now compiles with ghc-0.26.

* Support for monadic parsers via %monad (see the documentation).

* New syntax: previously

	f :: { <type> }
	f : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  can now be written

	f :: { <type> }
	  : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  (i.e. omit the extra 'f'.  It was always ignored anyway :-)

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.
