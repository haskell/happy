This document holds some useful information for developing Happy.

CI on GitHub Actions
====================

2024-07-15
----------

The GHC workflow file `.github/workflows/haskell-ci.yml` is generated by:

    haskell-ci regenerate

Releasing a new version of happy
================================

There are release scripts `./hackage-upload.sh` and `lib/hackage-upload.sh` to upload new releases to hackage.
These scripts include some sanity checks for issues that have caused problems for past releases.
`lib/hackage-upload.sh` must be run before `./hackage-upload.sh`, otherwise the latter fails.
Both scripts take an optional `--publish` argument that is forwarded to `cabal upload`.
If this flag is not present, only a package candidate will be uploaded.
