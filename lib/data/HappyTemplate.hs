{- Note [Error recovery]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When there is no applicable action for the current lookahead token `tk`,
happy enters error recovery mode. Depending on whether the grammar file
declares the two action form `%error { abort } { report }` for
    Resumptive Error Handling,
it works in one (not resumptive) or two phases (resumptive):

 1. Fixup mode:
    Try to see if there is an action for the error token ERROR_TOK. If there
    is, do *not* emit an error and pretend instead that an `error` token was
    inserted.
    When there is no ERROR_TOK action, report an error.

    In non-resumptive error handling, calling the single error handler
    (e.g. `happyError`) will throw an exception and abort the parser.
    However, in resumptive error handling we enter *error resumption mode*.

 2. Error resumption mode:
    After reporting the error (with `report`), happy will attempt to find
    a good state stack to resume parsing in.
    For each candidate stack, it discards input until one of the candidates
    resumes (i.e. shifts the current input).
    If no candidate resumes before the end of input, resumption failed and
    calls the `abort` function, to much the same effect as in non-resumptive
    error handling.

    Candidate stacks are declared by the grammar author using the special
    `catch` terminal and called "catch frames".
    This mechanism is described in detail in Note [happyResume].

The `catch` resumption mechanism (2) is what usually is associated with
`error` in `bison` or `menhir`. Since `error` is used for the Fixup mechanism
(1) above, we call the corresponding token `catch`.
Furthermore, in constrast to `bison`, our implementation of `catch`
non-deterministically considers multiple catch frames on the stack for
resumption (See Note [Multiple catch frames]).

Note [happyResume]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`happyResume` implements the resumption mechanism from Note [Error recovery].
It is best understood by example. Consider

Exp :: { String }
Exp : '1'                { "1" }
    | catch              { "catch" }
    | Exp '+' Exp %shift { $1 Happy_Prelude.++ " + " Happy_Prelude.++ $3 } -- %shift: associate 1 + 1 + 1 to the right
    | '(' Exp ')'        { "(" Happy_Prelude.++ $2 Happy_Prelude.++ ")" }

The idea of the use of `catch` here is that upon encountering a parse error
during expression parsing, we can gracefully degrade using the `catch` rule,
still producing a partial syntax tree and keep on parsing to find further
syntax errors.

Let's trace the parser state for input 11+1, which will error out after shifting 1.
After shifting, we have the following item stack (growing downwards and omitting
transitive closure items):

  State 0: %start_parseExp -> . Exp
  State 5: Exp -> '1' .

(Stack as a list of state numbers: [5,0].)
As Note [Error recovery] describes, we will first try Fixup mode.
That fails because no production can shift the `error` token.
Next we try Error resumption mode. This works as follows:

  1. Pop off the item stack until we find an item that can shift the `catch`
     token. (Implemented in `pop_items`.)
       * State 5 cannot shift catch. Pop.
       * State 0 can shift catch, which would transition into
          State 4: Exp -> catch .
     So record the *stack* `[4,0]` after doing the shift transition.
     We call this a *catch frame*, where the top is a *catch state*,
     corresponding to an item in which we just shifted a `catch` token.
     There can be multiple such catch stacks, see Note [Multiple catch frames].

  2. Discard tokens from the input until the lookahead can be shifted in one
     of the catch stacks. (Implemented in `discard_input_until_exp` and
     `some_catch_state_shifts`.)
       * We cannot shift the current lookahead '1' in state 4, so we discard
       * We *can* shift the next lookahead '+' in state 4, but only after
         reducing, which pops State 4 and goes to State 3:
           State 3: %start_parseExp -> Exp .
                    Exp -> Exp . '+' Exp
         Here we can shift '+'.
     As you can see, to implement this machinery we need to simulate
     the operation of the LALR automaton, especially reduction
     (`happySimulateReduce`).

Note [Multiple catch frames]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For fewer spurious error messages, it can be beneficial to trace multiple catch
items. Consider

Exp : '1'
    | catch
    | Exp '+' Exp %shift
    | '(' Exp ')'

Let's trace the parser state for input (;+1, which will error out after shifting (.
After shifting, we have the following item stack (growing downwards):

  State 0: %start_parseExp -> . Exp
  State 6: Exp -> '(' . Exp ')'

Upon error, we want to find items in the stack which can shift a catch token.
Note that both State 0 and State 6 can shift a catch token, transitioning into
  State 4: Exp -> catch .
Hence we record the catch frames `[4,6,0]` and `[4,0]` for possible resumption.

Which catch frame do we pick for resumption?
Note that resuming catch frame `[4,0]` will parse as "catch+1", whereas
resuming the innermost frame `[4,6,0]` corresponds to parsing "(catch+1".
The latter would keep discarding input until the closing ')' is found.
So we will discard + and 1, leading to a spurious syntax error at the end of
input, aborting the parse and never producing a partial syntax tree. Bad!

It is far preferable to resume with catch frame `[4,0]`, where we can resume
successfully on input +, so that is what we do.

In general, we pick the catch frame for resumption that discards the least
amount of input for a successful shift, preferring the topmost such catch frame.
