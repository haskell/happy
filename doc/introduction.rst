Introduction
============

Happy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool yacc for C.
Like yacc, it takes a file containing an annotated BNF specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing a parser for the grammar.

.. index::
  single: yacc

Happy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers in the same program, and each parser may have multiple entry points.
Happy can work in conjunction with a lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or generated by another program),
or it can parse a stream of characters directly (but this isn't practical in most cases).
In a future version we hope to include a lexical analyser generator with Happy as a single package.

Parsers generated by Happy are fast;
generally faster than an equivalent parser written using parsing combinators or similar tools.
Furthermore, any future improvements made to Happy will benefit an existing grammar, without need for a rewrite.

Happy is sufficiently powerful to parse full Haskell --- `GHC <http://www.haskell.org/ghc>`__ itself uses a Happy parser.

.. index::
  single: ``hsparser``
  see: Haskell parser; ``hsparser``

Happy can currently generate four types of parser from a given grammar,
the intention being that we can experiment with different kinds of functional code to see which is the best,
and compiler writers can use the different types of parser to tune their compilers.
The types of parser supported are:

   .. _item-standard-backend:

#. “standard” Haskell 98 (should work with any compiler that compiles Haskell 98).

#. standard Haskell using :index:`arrays`

   .. index::
     single: back-ends; arrays

   (this is not the default because we have found this generates slower parsers than
   the :ref:`standard <item-standard-backend>` backend).

#. Haskell with :index:`GHC` (Glasgow Haskell) extensions.

   .. index::
     single: back-ends; GHC

   This is a slightly faster option than the :ref:`standard <item-standard-backend>` backend for Glasgow Haskell users.

#. GHC Haskell with string-encoded arrays.
   This is the fastest/smallest option for GHC users.
   If you're using GHC, the optimum flag settings are ``-agc`` (see :ref:`Invoking <sec-invoking>`).

Happy can also generate parsers which will dump debugging information at run time,
showing state transitions and the input tokens to the parser.

.. _sec-compatibility:

Compatibility
-------------

Happy is written in Glasgow Haskell.
This means that (for the time being), you need GHC to compile it.
Any version of GHC >= 7.0 should work.

Remember: parsers produced using Happy should compile without difficulty under any Haskell 98 compiler or interpreter. [1]_

.. [1]
   With one exception:
   if you have a production with a polymorphic type signature, then a compiler that supports local universal quantification is required.
   See :ref:`Type Signatures <sec-type-signatures>`.

.. _sec-reporting-bugs:

Reporting Bugs
--------------

.. index::
   single: bugs; reporting

Any bugs found in Happy should be reported in the `Happy issue tracker <https://github.com/haskell/happy/issues>`__.
Please include all the relevant information:
the compiler used to compile Happy,
the command-line options used,
your grammar file or preferably a cut-down example showing the problem,
and a description of what goes wrong.
A patch to fix the problem would also be greatly appreciated.

Requests for new features should also be sent to the above address, especially if accompanied by patches :-).
