    <title>Introduction</title>


    <para> <application>Happy</application> is a parser generator
    system for Haskell, similar to the tool
    <application>yacc</application> for C.  Like
    <application>yacc</application>, it takes a file containing an
    annotated BNF specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell
    module containing a parser for the grammar. </para>
    
    <indexterm><primary>yacc</primary></indexterm>

    <para> <application>Happy</application> is flexible; unlike
    <application>yacc</application>, you can have several
    <application>Happy</application> parsers in the same program, and
    each parser may have multiple entry points.
    <application>Happy</application> can work in conjunction with a
    lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or
    generated by another program), or it can parse a stream of
    characters directly (but this isn't practical in most cases).  In
    a future version we hope to include a lexical analyser generator
    with <application>Happy</application> as a single package. </para>

    <para> Parsers generated by <application>Happy</application> are
    fast; generally faster than an equivalent parser written using
    parsing combinators or similar tools.  Furthermore, any future
    improvements made to <application>Happy</application> will benefit
    an existing grammar, without need for a rewrite. </para>

    <para> <application>Happy</application> is sufficiently powerful
    to parse Haskell itself - there's a freely available Haskell
    parser written using <application>Happy</application> which can be
    obtained from <ulink
    url="http://www.pms.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/mitarbeiter/panne/haskell_libs/hsparser.html">
    The <literal>hsparser</literal> Page</ulink>, and included with versions of
    GHC from 5.00 onwards.</para>

    <para> <application>Happy</application> can currently generate
    four types of parser from a given grammar, the intention being
    that we can experiment with different kinds of functional code to
    see which is the best, and compiler writers can use the different
    types of parser to tune their compilers.  The types of parser
    supported are: </para>

      </listitem>

    </orderedlist>

    <para>Happy can also generate parsers which will dump debugging
    information at run time, showing state transitions and the input
    tokens to the parser.</para>

<!-- Using Happy------------------------------------------------------------ -->

  <chapter id="sec-using">
    <title>Using <application>Happy</application></title>

  <para> Users of <application>Yacc</application> will find
  <application>Happy</application> quite familiar.  The basic idea is
  as follows: </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Define the grammar you want to parse in a
      <application>Happy</application> grammar file. </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para> Run the grammar through <application>Happy</application>, to generate
      a compilable Haskell module.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para> Use this module as part of your Haskell program, usually
      in conjunction with a lexical analyser (a function that splits
      the input into ``tokens'', the basic unit of parsing).</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para> Let's run through an example.  We'll implement a parser for a
  simple expression syntax, consisting of integers, variables, the
  operators <literal>+</literal>, <literal>-</literal>, <literal>*</literal>,
  <literal>/</literal>, and the form <literal>let var = exp in exp</literal>.
  The grammar file starts off like this:</para>

    <programlisting>
{
module Main where
}
</programlisting>

    <para>At the top of the file is an optional <firstterm>module
    header</firstterm>,
      <indexterm>
	<primary>module</primary>
	<secondary>header</secondary>
      </indexterm>
    which is just a Haskell module header enclosed in braces.  This
    code is emitted verbatim into the generated module, so you can put
    any Haskell code here at all.  In a grammar file, Haskell code is
    always contained between curly braces to distinguish it from the
    grammar.</para>

    <para>In this case, the parser will be a standalone program so
    we'll call the module <literal>Main</literal>.</para>

    <para>Next comes a couple of declarations:</para>

<programlisting>
%name calc
%tokentype { Token }
</programlisting>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><literal>%name</literal></primary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary><literal>%tokentype</literal></primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The first line declares the name of the parsing function
    that <application>Happy</application> will generate, in this case
    <literal>calc</literal>.  In many cases, this is the only symbol you need
    to export from the module.</para>

    <para>The second line declares the type of tokens that the parser
    will accept.  The parser (i.e. the function
    <function>calc</function>) will be of type <literal>[Token] ->
    T</literal>, where <literal>T</literal> is the return type of the
    parser, determined by the production rules below.</para>

    <para>Now we declare all the possible tokens:</para>

<programlisting>
%token 
      let             { TokenLet }
      in              { TokenIn }
      int             { TokenInt $$ }
      var             { TokenVar $$ }
      '='             { TokenEq }
      '+'             { TokenPlus }
      '-'             { TokenMinus }
      '*'             { TokenTimes }
      '/'             { TokenDiv }
      '('             { TokenOB }
      ')'             { TokenCB }
</programlisting>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><literal>%token</literal></primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The symbols on the left are the tokens as they will be
    referred to in the rest of the grammar, and to the right of each
    token enclosed in braces is a Haskell pattern that matches the
    token.  The parser will expect to receive a stream of tokens, each
    of which will match one of the given patterns (the definition of
    the <literal>Token</literal> datatype is given later).</para>

    <para>The <literal>&dollar;&dollar;</literal> symbol is a placeholder that
    represents the <emphasis>value</emphasis> of this token.  Normally the value
    of a token is the token itself, but by using the
    <literal>&dollar;&dollar;</literal> symbol you can specify some component
    of the token object to be the value. </para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><literal>&dollar;&dollar;</literal></primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>Like yacc, we include <literal>%%</literal> here, for no real
    reason.</para>

<programlisting>
%%
</programlisting>

    <para>Now we have the production rules for the grammar.</para>

<programlisting>
Exp   : let var '=' Exp in Exp  { Let $2 $4 $6 }
      | Exp1                    { Exp1 $1 }

Exp1  : Exp1 '+' Term           { Plus $1 $3 }
      | Exp1 '-' Term           { Minus $1 $3 }
      | Term                    { Term $1 }

Term  : Term '*' Factor         { Times $1 $3 }
      | Term '/' Factor         { Div $1 $3 }
      | Factor                  { Factor $1 }

Factor			  
      : int                     { Int $1 }
      | var                     { Var $1 }
      | '(' Exp ')'             { Brack $2 }
</programlisting>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>non-terminal</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>Each production consists of a <firstterm>non-terminal</>
    symbol on the left, followed by a colon, followed by one or more
    expansions on the right, separated by <literal>|</literal>.  Each expansion
    has some Haskell code associated with it, enclosed in braces as
    usual.</para>

    <para>The way to think about a parser is with each symbol having a
    `value': we defined the values of the tokens above, and the
    grammar defines the values of non-terminal symbols in terms of
    sequences of other symbols (either tokens or non-terminals).  In a
    production like this:</para>

<programlisting>
n   : t_1 ... t_n   { E }
</programlisting>

    <para>whenever the parser finds the symbols <literal>t_1..t_n</literal> in
    the token stream, it constructs the symbol <literal>n</literal> and gives
    it the value <literal>E</literal>, which may refer to the values of
    <literal>t_1...t_n</literal> using the symbols
    <literal>&dollar;1...&dollar;n</literal>.</para>

    <para>The parser reduces the input using the rules in the grammar
    until just one symbol remains: the first symbol defined in the
    grammar (namely <literal>Exp</literal> in our example).  The value of this
    symbol is the return value from the parser.</para>

    <para>To complete the program, we need some extra code.  The
    grammar file may optionally contain a final code section, enclosed
    in curly braces.</para>

<programlisting>
{
</programlisting>

    <indexterm>
      <primary><function>happyError</></primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>All parsers must declare the function <function>happyError</function>,
    which is called when an error is detected. </para>

<programlisting>
happyError :: [Token] -> a
happyError _ = error "Parse error"
</programlisting>

    <para>Note that <literal>happyError</literal> must be polymorphic
    in its return type <literal>a</literal>, which usually means it
    must be a call to <literal>error</literal>.  We'll see in <xref
    linkend="sec-monads"> how to wrap the parser in a monad so that we
    can do something more sensible with errors.  It's also possible to
    keep track of line numbers in the parser for use in error
    messages, this is described in <xref
    linkend="sec-line-numbers">.</para>

    <para>Next we can declare the data type that represents the parsed
    expression:</para>

<programlisting>
data Exp  
      = Let String Exp Exp
      | Exp1 Exp1

data Exp1 
      = Plus Exp1 Term 
      | Minus Exp1 Term 
      | Term Term

data Term 
      = Times Term Factor 
      | Div Term Factor 
      | Factor Factor

data Factor 
      = Int Int 
      | Var String 
      | Brack Exp
</programlisting>

    <para>And the data structure for the tokens...</para>

<programlisting>
data Token
      = TokenLet
      | TokenIn
      | TokenInt Int
      | TokenVar String
      | TokenEq
      | TokenPlus
      | TokenMinus
      | TokenTimes
      | TokenDiv
      | TokenOB
      | TokenCB
 deriving Show
</programlisting>

    <para>... and a simple lexer that returns this data
    structure.</para>

<programlisting>
lexer :: String -> [Token]
lexer [] = []
lexer (c:cs) 
      | isSpace c = lexer cs
      | isAlpha c = lexVar (c:cs)
      | isDigit c = lexNum (c:cs)
lexer ('=':cs) = TokenEq : lexer cs
lexer ('+':cs) = TokenPlus : lexer cs
lexer ('-':cs) = TokenMinus : lexer cs
lexer ('*':cs) = TokenTimes : lexer cs
lexer ('/':cs) = TokenDiv : lexer cs
lexer ('(':cs) = TokenOB : lexer cs
lexer (')':cs) = TokenCB : lexer cs

lexNum cs = TokenInt (read num) : lexer rest
      where (num,rest) = span isDigit cs

lexVar cs =
   case span isAlpha cs of
      ("let",rest) -> TokenLet : lexer rest
      ("in",rest)  -> TokenIn : lexer rest
      (var,rest)   -> TokenVar var : lexer rest
</programlisting>

    <para>And finally a top-level function to take some input, parse
    it, and print out the result.</para>

<programlisting>
main = getContents >>= print . calc . lexer
}
</programlisting>

    <para>And that's it! A whole lexer, parser and grammar in a few
    dozen lines.  Another good example is <application>Happy</application>'s own
    parser. Several features in <application>Happy</application> were developed
    using this as an example.</para>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>info file</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>To generate the Haskell module for this parser, type the
    command <command>happy example.y</command> (where
    <filename>example.y</filename> is the name of the grammar file).
    The Haskell module will be placed in a file named
    <filename>example.hs</filename>.  Additionally, invoking the
    command <command>happy example.y -i</command> will produce the
    file <filename>example.info</filename> which contains detailed information
    about the parser, including states and reduction rules (see <xref
    linkend="sec-info-files">).  This can be invaluable for debugging
    parsers, but requires some knowledge of the operation of a
    shift-reduce parser. </para>

    <sect1 id="sec-other-datatypes">
      <title>Returning other datatypes</title>

      <para>In the above example, we used a data type to represent the
      syntax being parsed.  However, there's no reason why it has to
      be this way: you could calculate the value of the expression on
      the fly, using productions like this:</para>

<programlisting>
Term  : Term '*' Factor         { $1 * $3 }
      | Term '/' Factor         { $1 / $3 }
      | Factor                  { $1 }
</programlisting>

      <para>The value of a <literal>Term</literal> would be the value of the
      expression itself, and the parser could return an integer.  </para>

      <para>This works for simple expression types, but our grammar
      includes variables and the <literal>let</literal> syntax.  How do we know
      the value of a variable while we're parsing it?  We don't, but
      since the Haskell code for a production can be anything at all,
      we could make it a function that takes an environment of
      variable values, and returns the computed value of the
      expression:</para>

<programlisting>
Exp   : let var '=' Exp in Exp  { \p -> $6 (($2,$4 p):p) }
      | Exp1                    { $1 }

Exp1  : Exp1 '+' Term           { \p -> $1 p + $3 p }
      | Exp1 '-' Term           { \p -> $1 p - $3 p }
      | Term                    { $1 }

Term  : Term '*' Factor         { \p -> $1 p * $3 p }
      | Term '/' Factor         { \p -> $1 p `div` $3 p }
      | Factor                  { $1 }

Factor			  
      : int                     { \p -> $1 }
      | var                     { \p -> case lookup $1 p of
	                                    Nothing -> error "no var"
					    Just i  -> i }
      | '(' Exp ')'             { $2 }
</programlisting>

      <para>The value of each production is a function from an
      environment <emphasis>p</emphasis> to a value.  When parsing a
      <literal>let</literal> construct, we extend the environment with the new
      binding to find the value of the body, and the rule for
      <literal>var</literal> looks up its value in the environment.  There's
      something you can't do in <literal>yacc</literal> :-)</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="sec-sequences"> 
      <title>Parsing sequences</title>

      <para>A common feature in grammars is a <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> of a
      particular syntactic element.  In EBNF, we'd write something
      like <literal>n+</literal> to represent a sequence of one or more
      <literal>n</literal>s, and <literal>n*</literal> for zero or more.
      <application>Happy</application> doesn't support this syntax explicitly, but
      you can define the equivalent sequences using simple
      productions.</para>

      <para>For example, the grammar for <application>Happy</application> itself
      contains a rule like this:</para>

<programlisting>
prods : prod                   { [$1] }
      | prods prod             { $2 : $1 }
</programlisting>

      <para>In other words, a sequence of productions is either a
      single production, or a sequence of productions followed by a
      single production.  This recursive rule defines a sequence of
      one or more productions.</para>

      <para>One thing to note about this rule is that we used
      <emphasis>left recursion</emphasis> to define it - we could have written
      it like this:</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>recursion, left vs. right</primary>
      </indexterm>

<programlisting>
prods : prod                  { [$1] }
      | prod prods            { $1 : $2 }
</programlisting>

      <para>The only reason we used left recursion is that
      <application>Happy</application> is more efficient at parsing left-recursive
      rules; they result in a constant stack-space parser, whereas
      right-recursive rules require stack space proportional to the
      length of the list being parsed.  This can be extremely
      important where long sequences are involved, for instance in
      automatically generated output.  For example, the parser in GHC
      used to use right-recursion to parse lists, and as a result it
      failed to parse some <application>Happy</application>-generated modules due
      to running out of stack space!</para>

      <para>One implication of using left recursion is that the resulting
      list comes out reversed, and you have to reverse it again to get
      it in the original order.  Take a look at the
      <application>Happy</application> grammar for Haskell for many examples of
      this.</para>

      <para>Parsing sequences of zero or more elements requires a
      trivial change to the above pattern:</para>

<programlisting>
prods : {- empty -}           { [] }
      | prods prod            { $2 : $1 }
</programlisting>

      <para>Yes - empty productions are allowed.  The normal
      convention is to include the comment <literal>{- empty -}</literal> to
      make it more obvious to a reader of the code what's going
      on.</para>

      <sect2 id="sec-separators">
	<title>Sequences with separators</title>

	<para>A common type of sequence is one with a
        <emphasis>separator</emphasis>: for instance function bodies in C
        consist of statements separated by semicolons.  To parse this
        kind of sequence we use a production like this:</para>

<programlisting>
stmts : stmt                   { [$1] }
      | stmts ';' stmt         { $3 : $1 }
</programlisting>

	<para>If the <literal>;</literal> is to be a <emphasis>terminator</emphasis>
        rather than a separator (i.e. there should be one following
        each statement), we can remove the semicolon from the above
        rule and redefine <literal>stmt</literal> as</para>

<programlisting>
stmt : stmt1 ';'              { $1 }
</programlisting>

	<para>where <literal>stmt1</literal> is the real definition of statements.</para>

        <para>We might like to allow extra semicolons between
        statements, to be a bit more liberal in what we allow as legal
        syntax.  We probably just want the parser to ignore these
        extra semicolons, and not generate a ``null statement'' value
        or something.  The following rule parses a sequence or zero or
        more statements separated by semicolons, in which the
        statements may be empty:</para>

<programlisting>
stmts : stmts ';' stmt          { $3 : $1 }
      | stmts ';'               { $1 }
      | stmt			{ [$1] }
      | {- empty -}		{ [] }
</programlisting>

	<para>Parsing sequences of <emphasis>one</emphasis> or more possibly
	null statements is left as an exercise for the reader...</para>

      <para>Going back to our earlier expression-parsing example,
      wouldn't it be nicer if we didn't have to explicitly separate
      the expressions into terms and factors, merely to make it
      clear that <literal>'*'</literal> and <literal>'/'</literal>

<programlisting>

</programlisting>

      <para>but now Happy will complain that there are shift/reduce
      conflicts because the grammar is ambiguous - we haven't
      specified whether e.g. <literal>1 + 2 * 3</literal> is to be
      parsed as <literal>1 + (2 * 3)</literal> or <literal>(1 + 2) *
      3</literal>.  Happy allows these ambiguities to be resolved by
      specifying the <firstterm>precedences</firstterm> of the
      operators involved using directives in the
      header<footnote><para>Users of <literal>yacc</literal> will find
      this familiar, Happy's precedence scheme works in exactly the
      same way.</para></footnote>:</para>

<programlisting>

<indexterm><primary><literal>%left</literal> directive</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary><literal>%right</literal> directive</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary><literal>%nonassoc</literal> directive</primary></indexterm>
      
      <para>The <literal>%left</literal> or <literal>%right</literal>
      directive is followed by a list of terminals, and declares all
      these tokens to be left or right-associative respectively.  The
      precedence of these tokens with respect to other tokens is
      established by the order of the <literal>%left</literal> and
      <literal>%right</literal> directives: earlier means lower
      precedence.  A higher precedence causes an operator to bind more
      tightly; in our example above, because <literal>'*'</literal>
      has a higher precedence than <literal>'+'</literal>, the
      expression <literal>1 + 2 * 3</literal> will parse as <literal>1
      + (2 * 3)</literal>.</para>

      <para>What happens when two operators have the same precedence?
      This is when the <firstterm>associativity</firstterm> comes into
      play.  Operators specified as left associative will cause
      expressions like <literal>1 + 2 - 3</literal> to parse as
      <literal>(1 + 2) - 3</literal>, whereas right-associative
      operators would parse as <literal>1 + (2 - 3)</literal>.  There
      is also a <literal>%nonassoc</literal> directive which indicates
      that the specified operators may not be used together.  For
      example, if we add the comparison operators
      <literal>'>'</literal> and <literal>'<'</literal> to our
      grammar, then we would probably give their precedence as:</para>

<programlisting>
...
%nonassoc '>' '<'
%right in
%left '+' '-'
%left '*' '/'
%%
...
</programlisting>

      <para>which indicates that <literal>'>'</literal> and
      <literal>'<'</literal> bind less tightly than the other
      operators, and the non-associativity causes expressions such as
      <literal>1 > 2 > 3</literal> to be disallowed.</para>

	<listitem>
	  <para> Fixing type errors in the generated module can become

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The syntax for type signatures in the grammar file is as
      follows:</para>

<programlisting>
stmts   :: { [ Stmt ] }
stmts   : stmts stmt                { $2 : $1 }

	</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

      <para>Adding monadic support to your parser couldn't be simpler.
      Just add the following directive to the declaration section of
      the grammar file:</para>

<programlisting>
%monad { &lt;type&gt; } [ { &lt;then&gt; } { &lt;return&gt; } ]
</programlisting>

      <indexterm>
	<primary><literal>%monad</></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>where <literal>&lt;type&gt;</literal> is the type constructor for
      the monad, <literal>&lt;then&gt;</literal> is the bind operation of the
      monad, and <literal>&lt;return&gt;</literal> is the return operation. If
      you leave out the names for the bind and return operations,
      <application>Happy</application> assumes that <literal>&lt;type&gt;</literal> is an
      instance of the standard Haskell type class <literal>Monad</literal> and
      uses the overloaded names for the bind and return
      operations.</para>

      <para>When this declaration is included in the grammar,
      <application>Happy</application> makes a couple of changes to the generated
      parser: the types of the main parser function and
      <literal>happyError</literal> become <literal>[Token] -&gt; P a</literal> where
      <literal>P</literal> is the monad type constructor, and the function must
      be polymorphic in <literal>a</literal>.  In other words,
      <application>Happy</application> adds an application of the
      <literal>&lt;return&gt;</literal> operation defined in the declaration
      above, around the result of the parser (<literal>happyError</literal> is
      affected because it must have the same return type as the
      parser).  And that's all it does.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary><function>happyError</></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>This still isn't very useful: all you can do is return
      something of monadic type from <literal>happyError</literal>.  How do you
      specify that the productions can also have type <literal>P a</literal>?
      Most of the time, you don't want a production to have this type:
      you'd have to write explicit <literal>returnP</literal>s everywhere.
      However, there may be a few rules in a grammar that need to get
      at the monad, so <application>Happy</application> has a special syntax for
      monadic actions:</para>

<programlisting>
n  :  t_1 ... t_n          {% &lt;expr&gt; }
</programlisting>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>monadic</primary>
	<secondary>actions</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>The <literal>%</literal> in the action indicates that this is a
      monadic action, with type <literal>P a</literal>, where <literal>a</literal> is
      the real return type of the production.  When
      <application>Happy</application> reduces one of these rules, it evaluates the
      expression </para>

<programlisting>
&lt;expr&gt; `then` \result -> &lt;continue parsing&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para><application>Happy</application> uses <literal>result</literal> as the real
      semantic value of the production.  During parsing, several
      monadic actions might be reduced, resulting in a sequence
      like</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;expr1&gt; `then` \r1 ->
&lt;expr2&gt; `then` \r2 ->
...
return &lt;expr3&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>The monadic actions are performed in the order that they
      are <emphasis>reduced</emphasis>.  If we consider the parse as a tree,
      then reductions happen in a depth-first left-to-right manner.
      The great thing about adding a monad to your parser is that it
      doesn't impose any performance overhead for normal reductions -
      only the monadic ones are translated like this.</para>

      <para>Take a look at the Haskell parser for a good illustration
      of how to use a monad in your parser: it contains examples of
      all the principles discussed in this section, namely parse
      errors, a threaded lexer, line/column numbers, and state
      communication between the parser and lexer.</para>

      <para>The following sections consider a couple of uses for
      monadic parsers, and describe how to also thread the monad
      through the lexical analyser.</para>

	<title>Handling Parse Errors</title>
	<indexterm>
	  <primary>parse errors</primary>
	  <secondary>handling</secondary>
	</indexterm>
	    
      <para>It's not very convenient to just call <literal>error</literal> when
      a parse error is detected: in a robust setting, you'd like the
      program to recover gracefully and report a useful error message
      to the user.  Exceptions (of which errors are a special case)
      are normally implemented in Haskell by using an exception monad,
      something like:</para>

<programlisting>
data E a = Ok a | Failed String

thenE :: E a -> (a -> E b) -> E b
m `thenE` k = 
   case m of 
       Ok a -> k a
	 Failed e -> Failed e

returnE :: a -> E a
returnE a = Ok a

failE :: String -> E a
failE err = Failed err

catchE :: E a -> (String -> E a) -> E a
catchE m k = 
   case m of
      Ok a -> OK a
	Failed e -> k e
</programlisting>

	<para>This monad just uses a string as the error type.  The
        functions <literal>thenE</literal> and <literal>returnE</literal> are the usual
        bind and return operations of the monad, <literal>failE</literal>
        raises an error, and <literal>catchE</literal> is a combinator for
        handling exceptions.</para>

	<para>We can add this monad to the parser with the declaration</para>

<programlisting>
%monad { E } { thenE } { returnE }
</programlisting>

	<para>Now, without changing the grammar, we can change the
        definition of <literal>happyError</literal> and have something sensible
        happen for a parse error:</para>

<programlisting>
happyError tokens = failE "Parse error"
</programlisting>
	  <indexterm>
	    <primary><function>happyError</></primary>
	  </indexterm>

	<para>The parser now raises an exception in the monad instead
	of bombing out on a parse error.</para>

	<para>We can also generate errors during parsing.  There are
        times when it is more convenient to parse a more general
        language than that which is actually intended, and check it
        later.  An example comes from Haskell, where the precedence
        values in infix declarations must be between 0 and 9:</para>

<programlisting>
prec :: { Int }
      : int    {% if $1 < 0 || $1 > 9 
	                then failE "Precedence out of range"
		        else returnE $1
		}
</programlisting>

	<para>The monadic action allows the check to be placed in the
	parser itself, where it belongs.</para>

        analyser function, and <literal>&lt;eof&gt;</literal> is a token that
        is to be treated as the end of file.</para>

	<para>When using a monadic lexer, the parser no longer reads a
        list of tokens.  Instead, it calls the lexical analysis
        function for each new token to be read.  This has the side
        effect of eliminating the intermediate list of tokens, which
        is a slight performance win.</para>

	<para>The type of the main parser function and
        <literal>happyError</literal> is now just <literal>P a</literal> - the input is
        being handled completely within the monad.</para>
	<indexterm>
	  <primary><function>happyError</></primary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>The lexical analysis function must have the following
	type:</para>

<programlisting>
lexer :: (Token -> P a) -> P a
</programlisting>

	<para>where <literal>P</literal> is the monad type constructor declared
        with <literal>%monad</literal>, and <literal>a</literal> can be replaced by the
        parser return type if desired.</para>

	<para>You can see from this type that the lexer takes a
        <emphasis>continuation</emphasis> as an argument.  The lexer is to find
        the next token, and pass it to this continuation to carry on
        with the parse.  Obviously, we need to keep track of the input
        in the monad somehow, so that the lexer can do something
        different each time it's called!</para>

	<para>Let's take the exception monad above, and extend it to
        add the input string so that we can use it with a threaded
        lexer.</para>

<programlisting>
data ParseResult a = Ok a | Failed String
type P a = String -> ParseResult a

thenP :: P a -> (a -> P b) -> P b
m `thenP` k = \s ->
   case m s of 
       Ok a -> k a s
	 Failed e -> Failed e

returnP :: a -> P a
returnP a = \s -> Ok a

failP :: String -> P a
failP err = \s -> Failed err

catchP :: P a -> (String -> P a) -> P a
catchP m k = \s ->
   case m s of
      Ok a -> OK a
	Failed e -> k e s
</programlisting>

	<para>Notice that this isn't a real state monad - the input
        string just gets passed around, not returned.  Our lexer will
        now look something like this:</para>

<programlisting>
lexer :: (Token -> P a) -> P a
lexer cont s = 
    ... lexical analysis code ...
    cont token s'
</programlisting>

	<para>the lexer grabs the continuation and the input string,
        finds the next token <literal>token</literal>, and passes it together
        with the remaining input string <literal>s'</literal> to the
        continuation.</para>

	<para>We can now indicate lexical errors by ignoring the
        continuation and calling <literal>failP "error message" s</literal>
        within the lexer (don't forget to pass the input string to
        make the types work out).</para>

	<para>This may all seem a bit weird.  Why, you ask, doesn't
        the lexer just have type <literal>P Token</literal>?  Well, the
        decision was taken to use a continuation purely for
        performance reasons.  If the lexer must return a token, then
        it turns out that the input string must be a real state
        object, and the monad has to return it as well as pass it
        around.  If you want a lexer of type <literal>P Token</literal>, then
        just define a wrapper to deal with the continuation:</para>

<programlisting>
lexwrap :: (Token -> P a) -> P a
lexwrap cont = real_lexer `thenP` \token -> cont token
</programlisting>

	<para>Previous versions of <application>Happy</application> had a
        <literal>%newline</literal> directive that enabled simple line numbers
        to be counted by the parser and referenced in the actions.  We
        warned you that this facility may go away and be replaced by
        something more general, well guess what? :-)</para>

	<para>Line numbers can now be dealt with quite
        straightforwardly using a monadic parser/lexer combination.
        Ok, we have to extend the monad a bit more:</para>

<programlisting>
type LineNumber = Int
type P a = String -> LineNumber -> ParseResult a

getLineNo :: P LineNumber
getLineNo = \s l -> Ok l
</programlisting>

	<para>(the rest of the functions in the monad follow by just
        adding the extra line number argument in the same way as the
        input string).  Again, the line number is just passed down,
        not returned: this is OK because of the continuation-based
        lexer that can change the line number and pass the new one to
        the continuation.</para>

	<para>The lexer can now update the line number as follows:</para>

<programlisting>
lexer cont s =
  case s of
     '\n':s  ->  \line -> lexer cont s (line + 1)
     ... rest of lexical analysis ...
</programlisting>

	<para>It's as simple as that.  Take a look at
        <application>Happy</application>'s own parser if you have the sources lying
        around, it uses a monad just like the one above.</para>

        <para>Reporting the line number of a parse error is achieved
        by changing <literal>happyError</literal> to look something like
        this:</para>

<programlisting>
happyError :: P a
happyError = getLineNo `thenP` \line -> 
             failP (show line ++ ": parse error")
</programlisting>
	<indexterm>
	  <primary><function>happyError</></primary>
	</indexterm>

	<para>We can also get hold of the line number during parsing,
        to put it in the parsed data structure for future reference.
        A good way to do this is to have a production in the grammar
        that returns the current line number: </para>

<programlisting>
lineno :: { LineNumber }
        : {- empty -}      {% getLineNo }
</programlisting>

	<para>The semantic value of <literal>lineno</literal> is the line
        number of the last token read - this will always be the token
        directly following the <literal>lineno</literal> symbol in the grammar,
        since <application>Happy</application> always keeps one lookahead token in
        reserve.</para>

      <title>The Error Token</title>
      <indexterm>
	<primary>error token</primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para><application>Happy</application> supports a limited form of error
      recovery, using the special symbol <literal>error</literal> in a grammar
      file.  When <application>Happy</application> finds a parse error during
      parsing, it automatically inserts the <literal>error</literal> symbol; if
      your grammar deals with <literal>error</literal> explicitly, then it can
      detect the error and carry on.</para>

      <para>For example, the <application>Happy</application> grammar for Haskell
      uses error recovery to implement Haskell layout.  The grammar
      has a rule that looks like this:</para>

<programlisting>
close : '}'                  { () }
      | error		     { () }
</programlisting>

      <para>This says that a close brace in a layout-indented context
      may be either a curly brace (inserted by the lexical analyser),
      or a parse error.  </para>

      <para>This rule is used to parse expressions like <literal>let x
      = e in e'</literal>: the layout system inserts an open brace before
      <literal>x</literal>, and the occurrence of the <literal>in</literal> symbol
      generates a parse error, which is interpreted as a close brace
      by the above rule.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary><application>yacc</application></primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>Note for <literal>yacc</literal> users: this form of error recovery
      is strictly more limited than that provided by <literal>yacc</literal>.
      During a parse error condition, <literal>yacc</literal> attempts to
      discard states and tokens in order to get back into a state
      where parsing may continue; <application>Happy</application> doesn't do this.
      The reason is that normal <literal>yacc</literal> error recovery is
      notoriously hard to describe, and the semantics depend heavily
      on the workings of a shift-reduce parser.  Furthermore,
      different implementations of <literal>yacc</literal> appear to implement
      error recovery differently.  <application>Happy</application>'s limited error
      recovery on the other hand is well-defined, as is just
      sufficient to implement the Haskell layout rule (which is why it
      was added in the first place).</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>multiple parsers</primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>It is often useful to use a single grammar to describe
      multiple parsers, where each parser has a different top-level
      non-terminal, but parts of the grammar are shared between
      parsers.  A classic example of this is an interpreter, which
      needs to be able to parse both entire files and single
      expressions: the expression grammar is likely to be identical
      for the two parsers, so we would like to use a single grammar
      but have two entry points.</para>

      <para><application>Happy</application> lets you do this by
      allowing multiple <literal>%name</literal> directives in the
      grammar file.  The <literal>%name</literal> directive takes an
      optional second parameter specifying the top-level
      non-terminal for this parser, so we may specify multiple parsers
      like so:</para>
      <indexterm><primary><literal>%name</literal> directive</primary>
      </indexterm>

<programlisting>
%name parse1 non-terminal1
%name parse2 non-terminal2
</programlisting>

      <para><application>Happy</application> will generate from this a
      module which defines two functions <function>parse1</function>
      and <function>parse2</function>, which parse the grammars given
      by <literal>non-terminal1</literal> and
      <literal>non-terminal2</literal> respectively.  Each parsing
      function will of course have a different type, depending on the
      type of the appropriate non-terminal.</para>

      following form:</para>

<programlisting>
{  
&lt;Haskell module header&gt;

</programlisting>

      <para>The Haskell module header contains the module name,
      exports, and imports.  No other code is allowed in the
      header---this is because <application>Happy</application> may need to include
      its own <literal>import</literal> statements directly after the user
      defined header.</para>

<programlisting>

	<para>(mandatory) The <literal>%tokentype</literal> directive gives the

	<para>(mandatory) The <literal>%token</literal> directive is used to
        tell <application>Happy</application> about all the terminal symbols used
        in the grammar.  Each terminal has a name, by which it is
        referred to in the grammar itself, and a Haskell
        representation enclosed in braces.  Each of the patterns must
        be of the same type, given by the <literal>%tokentype</literal>
        directive.</para>

	<para>The name of each terminal follows the lexical rules for
        <application>Happy</application> identifiers given above.  There are no
        lexical differences between terminals and non-terminals in the
        grammar, so it is recommended that you stick to a convention;
        for example using upper case letters for terminals and lower
        case for non-terminals, or vice-versa.</para>

	<para><application>Happy</application> will give you a warning if you try
        to use the same identifier both as a non-terminal and a
        terminal, or introduce an identifier which is declared as
        neither.</para>

	<para>To save writing lots of projection functions that map
        tokens to their components, you can include
        <literal>&dollar;&dollar;</literal> in your Haskell pattern. For
        example:</para>
	<indexterm>
	  <primary><literal>&dollar;&dollar;</></primary>

of <literal>TokenInt</literal> rather than the whole token, eliminating the need for
any projection function.</para>

      </indexterm>

      <para>Finding type errors in grammar files is inherently
      difficult because the code for reductions is moved around before
      being placed in the parser.  We currently have no way of passing
      the original filename and line numbers to the Haskell compiler,
      so there is no alternative but to look at the parser and match
      the code to the grammar file.  An info file (generated by the
      <literal>-i</literal> option) can be helpful here.</para>

      <indexterm>
	<primary>type</primary>

      </indexterm>

      <para>Type signature sometimes help by pinning down the
      particular error to the place where the mistake is made, not
      half way down the file.  For each production in the grammar,
      there's a bit of code in the generated file that looks like
      this:</para>

<programlisting>
HappyAbsSyn&lt;n&gt; ( E )
</programlisting>
      <indexterm>
	<primary><literal>HappyAbsSyn</></primary>
      </indexterm>

      <para>where <literal>E</literal> is the Haskell expression from the
      grammar file (with <literal>&dollar;n</literal> replaced by
      <literal>happy_var_n</literal>).  If there is a type signature for this
      production, then <application>Happy</application> will have taken it into
      account when declaring the HappyAbsSyn datatype, and errors in
      <literal>E</literal> will be caught right here.  Of course, the error may
      be really caused by incorrect use of one of the
      <literal>happy_var_n</literal> variables.</para>

      <title>Conflict Tips</title>
      <indexterm>
	<primary>conflicts</primary>
      </indexterm>
      
      <para>Conflicts arise from ambiguities in the grammar.  That is,
      some input sequences may possess more than one parse.
      Shift/reduce conflicts are benign in the sense that they are
      easily resolved (<application>Happy</application> automatically selects the
      shift action, as this is usually the intended one).
      Reduce/reduce conflicts are more serious.  A reduce/reduce
      conflict implies that a certain sequence of tokens on the input
      can represent more than one non-terminal, and the parser is
      uncertain as to which reduction rule to use.  It will select the
      reduction rule uppermost in the grammar file, so if you really
      must have a reduce/reduce conflict you can select which rule
      will be used by putting it first in your grammar file.</para>

      <para>It is usually possible to remove conflicts from the
      grammar, but sometimes this is at the expense of clarity and
      simplicity.  Here is a cut-down example from the grammar of
      Haskell (1.2):</para>

<programlisting>
exp     : exp op exp0
        | exp0

exp0    : if exp then exp else exp
        ...
        | atom

atom    : var
        | integer
        | '(' exp ')'
        ...
</programlisting>

      <para>This grammar has a shift/reduce conflict, due to the
      following ambiguity.  In an input such as</para>

<programlisting>
if 1 then 2 else 3 + 4
</programlisting>

      <para>the grammar doesn't specify whether the parse should be</para>

<programlisting>
if 1 then 2 else (3 + 4)
</programlisting>

      <para>or</para>

<programlisting>
(if 1 then 2 else 3) + 4
</programlisting>

      <para>and the ambiguity shows up as a shift/reduce conflict on
      reading the 'op' symbol.  In this case, the first parse is the
      intended one (the 'longest parse' rule), which corresponds to
      the shift action.  Removing this conflict relies on noticing
      that the expression on the left-hand side of an infix operator
      can't be an <literal>exp0</literal> (the grammar previously said
      otherwise, but since the conflict was resolved as shift, this
      parse was not allowed).  We can reformulate the
      <literal>exp</literal> rule as:</para>

<programlisting>
exp     : atom op exp
        | exp0
</programlisting>

      <para>and this removes the conflict, but at the expense of some
      stack space while parsing (we turned a left-recursion into a
      right-recursion).  There are alternatives using left-recursion,
      but they all involve adding extra states to the parser, so most
      programmers will prefer to keep the conflict in favour of a
      clearer and more efficient parser.</para>

      <sect2 id="sec-lalr">
	<title>LALR(1) parsers</title>

	<para>There are three basic ways to build a shift-reduce
        parser.  Full LR(1) (the `L' is the direction in which the
        input is scanned, the `R' is the way in which the parse is
        built, and the `1' is the number of tokens of lookahead)
        generates a parser with many states, and is therefore large
        and slow.  SLR(1) (simple LR(1)) is a cut-down version of
        LR(1) which generates parsers with roughly one-tenth as many
        states, but lacks the power to parse many grammars (it finds
        conflicts in grammars which have none under LR(1)). </para>

	<para>LALR(1) (look-ahead LR(1)), the method used by
        <application>Happy</application> and
        <application>yacc</application>, is tradeoff between the two.
        An LALR(1) parser has the same number of states as an SLR(1)
        parser, but it uses a more complex method to calculate the
        lookahead tokens that are valid at each point, and resolves
        many of the conflicts that SLR(1) finds.  However, there may
        still be conflicts in an LALR(1) parser that wouldn't be there
        with full LR(1).</para>
