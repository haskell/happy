This means rule $a$, with dot at $b$ (all starting at 0)

Generating the closure of a set of LR(0) items

Precalculate the rule closure for each non-terminal in the grammar,
using a memo table so that no work is repeated.

Subtract the first set of items from the second.

> subtract_items :: [Lr1Item] -> [Lr1Item] -> [Lr1Item]
> subtract_items items1 items2 = foldr (subtract_item items2) [] items1

These utilities over item sets are crucial to performance.

Stamp on overloading with judicious use of type signatures...

goto(I,X) function

The input should be the closure of a set of kernel items I together with
a token X (terminal or non-terminal.  Output will be the set of kernel
items for the set of items goto(I,X)

> gotoClosure :: Grammar -> Set Lr0Item -> Name -> Set Lr0Item
> gotoClosure gram i x = unionMap fn i
>    where
>       fn (Lr0 rule_no dot) =
>          case findRule gram rule_no dot of
>               Just t | x == t -> Set.singleton (Lr0 rule_no (dot+1))
>               _ -> Set.empty

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generating LR0 Item sets

The item sets are generated in much the same way as we find the
closure of a set of items: we use two sets, those which have already
generated more sets, and those which have just been generated.  We
keep iterating until the second set is empty.

The addItems function is complicated by the fact that we need to keep
information about which sets were generated by which others.

> type ItemSetWithGotos = (Set Lr0Item, [(Name,Int)])

> genLR0items :: Grammar -> (Name -> RuleList) -> [ItemSetWithGotos]
> genLR0items g precalcClosures
>       = fst (mkClosure (\(_,new) _ -> null new)
>               addItems
>                 (([],startRules)))
>  where

>    n_starts = length (starts g)
>    startRules :: [Set Lr0Item]
>    startRules = [ Set.singleton (Lr0 rule 0) | rule <- [0..n_starts] ]

>    tokens = non_terminals g ++ terminals g

>    addItems :: ([ItemSetWithGotos], [Set Lr0Item])
>             -> ([ItemSetWithGotos], [Set Lr0Item])
>
>    addItems (oldSets,newSets) = (newOldSets, reverse newNewSets)
>     where
>
>       newOldSets = oldSets ++ (zip newSets intgotos)

>       itemSets = map fst oldSets ++ newSets

First thing to do is for each set in I in newSets, generate goto(I,X)
for each token (terminals and nonterminals) X.

>       gotos :: [[(Name,Set Lr0Item)]]
>       gotos = map (filter (not . Set.null . snd))
>           (map (\i -> let i' = closure0 g precalcClosures i in
>                       [ (x,gotoClosure g i' x) | x <- tokens ]) newSets)

Next, we assign each new set a number, which is the index of this set
in the list of sets comprising all the sets generated so far plus
those generated in this iteration.  We also filter out those sets that
are new, i.e. don't exist in the current list of sets, so that they
can be added.

We also have to make sure that there are no duplicate sets in the
*current* batch of goto(I,X) sets, as this could be disastrous.  I
think I've squished this one with the '++ reverse newSets' in
numberSets.

numberSets is built this way so we can use it quite neatly with a foldr.
Unfortunately, the code's a little opaque.

>       numberSets
>               :: [(Name,Set Lr0Item)]
>               -> (Int,
>                   [[(Name,Int)]],
>                   [Set Lr0Item])
>               -> (Int, [[(Name,Int)]], [Set Lr0Item])
>
>       numberSets [] (i,gotos',newSets') = (i,([]:gotos'),newSets')
>       numberSets ((x,gotoix):rest) (i,g':gotos',newSets')
>          = numberSets rest
>               (case indexInto 0 gotoix (itemSets ++ reverse newSets') of
>                       Just j  -> (i,  ((x,j):g'):gotos', newSets')
>                       Nothing -> (i+1,((x,i):g'):gotos', gotoix:newSets'))
>       numberSets _ _ = error "genLR0items/numberSets: Unhandled case"

Finally, do some fiddling around to get this all in the form we want.

>       intgotos :: [[(Name,Int)]]
>       newNewSets  :: [Set Lr0Item]
>       (_, ([]:intgotos), newNewSets) =
>               foldr numberSets (length newOldSets, [[]], []) gotos

> indexInto :: Eq a => Int -> a -> [a] -> Maybe Int
> indexInto _ _ []                 = Nothing
> indexInto i x (y:ys) | x == y    = Just i
>                      | otherwise = let j = i + 1 in j `seq` indexInto j x ys

Computing propagation of lookaheads

calcLookaheads pass.

The lookahead for a start rule depends on whether it was declared
with %name or %partial: a %name parser is assumed to parse the whole
input, ending with EOF, whereas a %partial parser may parse only a
part of the input: it accepts when the error token is found.

> startLookahead gram partial = if partial then errorTok else eof_term gram

Calculate lookaheads

Special version using a mutable array:

>       :: Int                                  -- number of states
>       -> [(Int, Lr0Item, NameSet)]            -- spontaneous lookaheads
>       -> Array Int [(Lr0Item, Int, Lr0Item)]  -- propagated lookaheads
>       -> Array Int [(Lr0Item, NameSet)]

> calcLookaheads n_states spont prop
>       = runST $ do
>           arr <- newArray (0,n_states) []
>           propagate arr (fold_lookahead spont)
>           freeze arr

>   where
>       propagate :: STArray s Int [(Lr0Item, NameSet)]
>                        -> [(Int, Lr0Item, NameSet)] -> ST s ()
>       propagate _   []  = return ()
>       propagate arr new = do
>               let
>                  items = [ (i,item'',s) | (j,item,s) <- new,
>                                           (item',i,item'') <- prop ! j,

>               add_lookaheads arr new
>               propagate arr new_new

This function is needed to merge all the (set_no,item,name) triples
into (set_no, item, set name) triples.  It can be removed when we get
the spontaneous lookaheads in the right form to begin with (ToDo).

Merge lookaheads

Stick the lookahead info back into the state table.

Generate the goto table

This is pretty straightforward, given all the information we stored
while generating the LR0 sets of items.

Generating the goto table doesn't need lookahead info.

These comments are now out of date! /JS

Here's how we resolve conflicts, leaving a complete record of the
conflicting actions in an LR'Multiple structure for later output in
the info file.

Shift/reduce conflicts are always resolved as shift actions, and
reduce/reduce conflicts are resolved as a reduce action using the rule
with the lowest number (i.e. the rule that comes first in the grammar
file.)

NOTES on LR'MustFail: this was introduced as part of the precedence
parsing changes.  The problem with LR'Fail is that it is a soft
failure: we sometimes substitute an LR'Fail for an LR'Reduce (eg. when
computing default actions), on the grounds that an LR'Fail in this
state will also be an LR'Fail in the goto state, so we'll fail
eventually.  This may not be true with precedence parsing, though.  If
there are two non-associative operators together, we must fail at this
point rather than reducing.  Hence the use of LR'MustFail.


NOTE: on (LR'Multiple as a) handling
      PCC [sep04] has changed this to have the following invariants:
        * the winning action appears only once, in the "a" slot
        * only reductions appear in the "as" list
        * there are no duplications
      This removes complications elsewhere, where LR'Multiples were
      building up tree structures...
