Complete documentation can be found in the directory 'doc', in
DocBook XML format.  To format the documentation, the DocBook-Tools

provides all the bits & pieces you need.  Alternatively, pre-formatted
documentation is available from Happy's homepage (URL above).

The directory 'examples' contains some example parsers that use Happy.
